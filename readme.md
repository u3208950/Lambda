I created a chat bot, which book an appointment, tells customer about the product available on sell, ask the customer interested product, takes customer budget, preferred brand, and searched the best suitable item from the inventory and also share the stock details. If customer want to save order in the cart for future buy. In this chat bot I set it to save it in the table and if customer didn’t contact within 7 days then it automatically delete the order. If customer agreed to process the order then it save it in a permanent table by this practice , data handle become easy  and unwanted data is removed by the data records. On this chat bot I created a function through which a cart can be created for the new customers.
To start this project, I followed the first step by creating the flow diagram, this helped me to understand what all things are required and how a conversation is going to work over the chat.
In Second step I created all the required intent in my chat (intent means “to do thing”) I divided the project in parts 
•	Appointment 
•	productFInd
•	addToCart
•	checkout
•	getSavedCart
•	saveCart
•	whatsInMyCart
